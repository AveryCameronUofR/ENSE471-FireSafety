# ENSE471-FireSafety
This is an application developed for ENSE 471 User Interface Design for Fire Protective Services to simulate a 911 Call in a fire emergency. This application is intended to replace a touch tone phone simulation system and extend learning to the home. The application was developed in two week sprints for Deliverable 1, 2, and 3 with user feedback after each one. Deliverable 4 was a four week sprint for design implementation and delivering an MVP.

## Deliverable 1 - Information Gathering 
The Problem Definition process, Requirement Gathering, Empathy Maps, and Affinity Diagram. 
## Deliverable 2 - Lofi Brainstorming
The initial Lofi prototyping, Brainstorming, User Story Mapping and design input.
## Deliverable 3 - Hi-Fi Balsamiq Prototyping
The Hifi prototyping process, updated User Story Maps and design discussion.
## Deliverable 4 - MVP
