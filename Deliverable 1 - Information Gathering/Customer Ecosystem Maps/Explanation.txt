The development team (the us) is directly interacting with Tim and Fire & Protective Services through Candace.
Fire & Protective Services interact with the kids and community running programs in fire safety education and 
providing resources for the community and kids. 
Firefighters also interact with the kids in this programming for education of kids in the schools 
(they also interact with the community). The firefighters run the activities and 
programming created by Fire & Protective Services. 
The kids get the fire safety education from the schools and firefighters and bring the education into the community.
Fire & Protective Services has a large stake in the project with interactions with firefighters, kids 
and the community as a whole. Providing improved programming is a priority to increase fire safety and education. 

There is a lot of overlap between the Fire & Protective Services stake and firefighters stake that they could be 
laregly related. With kids and community, the similar overlap is there with interest and need for fire safety and 
fire safety education.
